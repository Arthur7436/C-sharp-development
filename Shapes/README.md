# Shapes Project

## Overview

The Shapes Project is a simple C# application developed to demonstrate the use of constructors and interfaces. The project delves into geometric shapes like circles and triangles, highlighting their properties and providing a foundation for understanding object-oriented principles in C#.

## Features

- **Interfaces**: Use of interfaces such as `CircleInterface` and `TriangleInterface` to enforce structure in shape classes.
- **Constructors**: Practical application of constructors for initializing geometric objects with specific properties.
- **Polymorphism**: Demonstrates how different objects like circles and triangles can utilize similar interfaces.

## Components

1. **CircleInterface**: Defines methods and properties for the `Circles` class.
2. **Circles Class**: Implements `CircleInterface` with methods to calculate circumference and radius.
3. **TriangleInterface**: Establishes methods and properties for the `Triangles` class.
4. **Triangles Class**: Implements `TriangleInterface` and provides functionality to calculate the area of a triangle based on given sides.
5. **Program**: The main entry point that creates instances of the `Circles` and `Triangles` classes and calculates their respective areas.
