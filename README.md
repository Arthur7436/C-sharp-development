- Can you give me a real life example to a problem that uses DAL ORM to make things more maintainable and non-conflicting
- Why should i move my serialization/deserialization logic to a repository class? What is a respository class?
- For the API section: Instead of creating another project, would it still be possible for me to implement API callings in my ECommerce project and it would still work?
