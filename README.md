Windows
 Note

NuGet.exe 5.0 and later require .NET Framework 4.7.2 or later to execute.

Visit nuget.org/downloads and select NuGet 3.3 or higher (2.8.6 is not compatible with Mono). The latest version is always recommended, and 4.1.0+ is required to publish packages to nuget.org.
Each download is the nuget.exe file directly. Instruct your browser to save the file to a folder of your choice. The file is not an installer; you won't see anything if you run it directly from the browser.
Add the folder where you placed nuget.exe to your PATH environment variable to use the CLI tool from anywhere.
