I am given the task to look within a c# class that has a method which has properties of quotes. I need to somehow use openapi preview to preview the openapi json file and see if any mappings are incorrect (if there is a mapping that shouldn't be there). What am i doing? What am i meant to do? How am i meant to use the openapi preview extension with vscode?
