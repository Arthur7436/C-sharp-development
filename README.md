I have cloned the repo but it seems that the references for the external classes aren't working in vscode. i tried dotnet restore and build but i'm getting errors. my colleague told me that it should pull down some nuget packages so that I can dig into that particular object. He said that nuget might be a little funky so i need to install the auth plugin. What am i meant to do from here? Here is the github repo: https://github.com/microsoft/artifacts-credprovider
