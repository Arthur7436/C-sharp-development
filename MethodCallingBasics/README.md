# MethodCallingBasics

This application demonstrates the basics of method calling in C#. It retrieves a name from an external class library and outputs a greeting.

## Project Overview:

The `MethodCallingBasics` application utilizes an external class named `OtherClass` from the `ClassLibrary` namespace to retrieve a name. This name is then printed to the console alongside a greeting message.
