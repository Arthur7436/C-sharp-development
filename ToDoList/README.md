# ToDoList

The `ToDoList` application serves as a basic console-based task manager. Users can interactively manage their list by adding and deleting tasks as well as viewing their current list of tasks.

## **Features**

- **Interactive Menu**: Navigate using arrow keys to choose from options.
- **Dynamic Task List**: Allows you to maintain a running list of tasks.
- **Stylish User Interface**: Enhanced with colors and borders for a clean visual representation.

## **How to Use**

1. **Run the Application**: Start the program to see the interactive menu.
2. **Navigation**: 
    - Use the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to navigate between options.
    - Press **Enter** to select an option.
3. **Options**:
    - **Show list**: Displays your current list of tasks.
    - **Add**: Allows you to add a new task to your list.
    - **Delete**: Choose a task by number to remove it from the list.
    - **Exit**: Gracefully shut down the application.

## **Tips**

- When selecting the **Delete** option, ensure you provide a valid number corresponding to the task list.
- While the application handles some user errors, it's always best to enter inputs as instructed to ensure a smooth user experience.
- Make sure to save important tasks externally, as the current version does not save tasks between sessions.

## **Future Enhancements**

- Allow tasks to be saved and retrieved across sessions.
- Integrate with a database for persistent storage.
